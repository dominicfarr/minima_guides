# Step 6 - Access the MDS Hub

Final step, if you made this far, great effort üëè

Accessing the Minima node MDS Hub via the browser is possible. 

 Get the url or IP of your EC2 instance from the AWS Console.

Either url or ip will work. Just add :8003 to the end. For my demo I would browser to the following address.

`https://ec2-35-170-202-212.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8003/`

After accepting the certificate warning‚Äîdue to the MDS site has a self signed certificate‚Äîyou will see the MDS Hub login page.
