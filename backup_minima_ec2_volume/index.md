## About these guides

These [guides](https://minima-guides.formulathoughts.com/) are only 1 stop in your [Minima](https://minima.global) journey.

[Minima](https://minima.global) can store value & AWS resources cost money, so I'm going to be clear: You follow this guide at your own risk. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Create a regular automatic backup of your Minima Node

This guide is about creating a regular backup of your data so if something goes wrong with your instance you can recover your Minima Node to the last backup. This is different to the [backup feature](https://docs.minima.global/docs/runanode/selectplatform/linux_vps#how-to-take-a-backup-of-your-node) in Minima. If you use the Minima backup feature you still need to protect your backup file outside of where you running your node. This guide is about how that can be done within AWS.

This guide is best as a following on from [Running Minima on an AWS EC2 instance](https://minima-guides.formulathoughts.com/minima_ec2/) and makes assumptions about your environment. That is, you have an AWS EC2 instance with an encrypted EBS volume where a Minima Node is storing its data. Something similar to this.

## Here are the high level steps

1. Tag your EBS for the DLM policy
2. Create a DLM or Data Lifecycle Manager Policy
3. Confirm your snapshot is created
